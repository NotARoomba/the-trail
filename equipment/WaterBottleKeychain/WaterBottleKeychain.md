# Water Bottle Keychain

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):** Sam Poder

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):** Yes, feeling nervous!

**What you are making?**

Basically, it's a keychain with a bunch of LEDs. The LEDs are a countdown timer that reminds you to drink water. After 20 minutes has passed, it'll start flashing red. Before the 20 minutes, it acts like a progress bar. It's a keychain you can attach to your pack so others can remind you to drink up.

**Inspiration:**

Thomas, Dieter and I went on an overnight hike up the mountain and... when we got to the top, realised that we didn't have water. Shucks. I designed this PCB on top of that mountain with Thomas' help. A kind man taught us how to filter water from the stream.

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**

Here's the PCB!
